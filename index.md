## Image classification of animals

I am currently building a classifier based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) to identify which animal is present in an image. I use a dataset consisting of labeled images containing one of 10 different animals availible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alessiocorrado99/animals10) for training and testing the CNN. Data are oversampled to balance the class distributions. This project is ongoing.

## Sentiment analysis of Yelp reviews

I built a classifier based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) with [Keras](https://keras.io/) for predicting the sentiment--positive or negative--of customer reviews. I use the Yelp reviews dataset availible on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset) to train and evaluate my model. Text is processed with a [spaCy](https://spacy.io/) pipeline using a [pre-trained English language model](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_lg).
